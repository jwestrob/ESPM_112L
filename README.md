# ESPM_112L
Markdown guides for ESPM 112L lab. 

These guides will include a how-to for most of the labs in ESPM112L, Microbial Ecology Data Analysis Lab, taught Spring 2020 at UC Berkeley.

Commands will be formatted as code blocks, starting with the `$` character (to indicate the bash prompt).

Guides will start at week 3.
