# Welcome to week 7 of metagenomics lab!

This week we're going to be going over some material that's very near and dear to my heart... phylogenomics!

A lot of microbial ecology research revolves around phylogenetic analysis, especially my own. So what is it, exactly?

Phylogenetics is basically the process by which we estimate relationships between organisms. You might be thinking, though, wasn't Jacob just calling it Phylogenomics?

Well, yes. There's a difference between the two. Phylogenomics is a variant of phylogenetics that uses DNA/protein sequence information to estimate organismal relationships. But remember, when Darwin drew that first phylogenetic tree,
