# Welcome to week 5 of lab! 


### This week we're going to be refining our bins and doing some additional binning using ESOMs (Emergent Self-Organizing Maps).
### This is a really interesting way of visualizing the way automated algorithms interpret and sort metagenomic data. Next week we'll be using automated binners, which utilize other unsupervised machine learning algorithms.
